# Red_Wine_Quality-DT-
This project predicts red wine quality using the Decision Tree algorithm. By analyzing features like acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol content, wine quality into different categories. Decision Trees help identify key factors influencing quality, providing an interpretable and efficient approach for winemakers to assess and improve their products.
( Decision tree is a tree-like structure that is used to model decisions and their possible consequences. Each internal node in the tree represents a decision, while each leaf node represents a possible outcome.)
